Following the late release of AO2 comes the beloved feature of making custom themes for the client.

Since there was freedom for custom content creation, we've seen numerous fan-made client skins.

This is also followed by a whopping increase in Danganronpa-based content servers.

We would like to welcome and say thanks to those die-hard Danganronpa community members
who share their works to increase the overall content of AO2.

We would also like to say thanks to Loki[Jerm 70] who always updates us
about his DR client.

You can check out his work down by the COMMUNITY MODS page!
