<div id="article1">
<p>Attorney Online 2 is an online roleplay game where players can choose their own characters and join simulated courtroom cases. <br><br> 
Not to be confused with <a href="http://www.aaonline.fr/" target="_blank" class="outlink">Ace Attorney Online</a>, where the good folks over there have premade singleplayer cases. <br><br>AO2 is completely multiplayer and requires the user to download content for a specific server they choose to participate in. And all of gameplay is purely roleplay.<br><br>Players can choose to join, make, or select a past case
featuring custom servers, characters, music, sound effects and much much more.<br> The only limit is really what you can create,<br> since you can create your own server with your own customized content <br>and enjoy a rich community filled with people of different interests,<br> as AO stretches further than just the Ace Attorney universe.<br><br>
<br>

<br><br>
We strongly advise you not to play this game if you have not yet played the <i>Ace Attorney series</i>.<br><br>This is so that you know the basic ins and outs of a courtroom case. The gameplay is <i>somewhat</i> like the Ace Attorney games, with an exception of that everything is purely roleplay. And if you haven't played any games from the series, you may be subjected to multiple spoilers.<br><br>
However, our game features content from different games that players may use. Therefore you can still play with custom content, however it is strongly recommended that you play the series first.
