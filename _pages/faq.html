<h4>What are the system requirements?</h4>
<p class="answer">Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10 are supported. Windows XP
was once supported, but is no longer supported because most Windows XP
computers are compatible with the latest Linux distros, which contain Wine.</p>
<p><strong>Linux (native 64-bit only)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Linux Mint 18</li>
	<li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial)</li>
	<li>Arch Linux</li>
	<li>Debian 9 (stretch)</li>
	<li>Gentoo 20160514</li>

2 GB of storage, stable Internet access, and a brain.</p>
